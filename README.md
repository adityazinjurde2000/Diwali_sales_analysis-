2)Descriptive Analytics:
Calculate total sales and profit.
Identify top-performing products and their categories.
Determine regions and zones contributing most to sales and profit.

3)Trend Analysis:
Analyze sales trends over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly).
Examine seasonality patterns (e.g., peak sales during Diwali).
Investigate the relationship between discounts and profits.

4)Customer Insights:
Identify the age groups generating the most sales and profit.
Analyze how different age groups respond to discounts.
Explore customer demographics such as gender, occupation, and marital status.

5)Product and Region Analysis:
Analyze the performance of different product categories.
Identify regions contributing the most to sales.
Correlate customer demographics with product preferences.

6)Actionable Recommendations:
Provide actionable insights based on analysis, such as optimizing discounts,
focusing on high-performing products/regions, and tailoring marketing efforts.

Data Analysis and Visualization Tools:
* Python: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing sales trends, product performance, and customer insights.

Expected Outcomes:
Data Insights:
Understanding of which customer demographics (age, gender, occupation) generate the most sales and profit.
Identification of top-performing products and regions.
Clear trend patterns (seasonality, discount impact) for better planning.

7) Visualizations:
Sales trends over time (line graphs for monthly/quarterly sales).
Distribution of sales across different product categories (bar charts).
Heatmaps for understanding correlations between discounts and sales.

8) Recommendations:
Focus marketing efforts on high-performing products.
Optimize discount strategies based on customer response and seasonal trends.
